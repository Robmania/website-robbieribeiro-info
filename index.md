      I've been developing applications for close to two decades now. The tools
      of my trade being **C#, Javascript / Angular, relational or document
      databases, Git, Microsoft Azure & Azure DevOps**.


      I've worked for small startups and I've worked for global multi-national
      corporations. As I said I like building things. 


      I've got a **Bachelors Degree in Informatics** from the University of
      South Africa (2004) as well being certified as a **Microsoft Certified
      Solutions Developer** since 2000. But as you know certificates mean little
      and my two decades of hands on experience speak volumes are what inform my
      decisions.
