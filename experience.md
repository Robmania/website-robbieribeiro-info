### 2011 - 2015: Developer @ Digiterre (London, UK)

[M & G Investments](http://www.mandg.co.uk/)

As a consultant working for Digiterre, I worked with four other Digiterre consultants at M & G Investments. Our mandate was to introduce agile practices into the development team at M & G. We incorporated Continuous integration into the development cycle, automated unit, integration and acceptance tests as well as automated application deployment and database deployment in all environments. We were also responsible for working closely with M & G developers in a coaching and mentoring capacity to teach new skills and impart accepted industry patterns and practices and design principles.

[EDF Trading](http://www.edftrading.com/)

As a consultant working for Digiterre, I worked on a small team of four developers in a highly agile fashion developing a small Master Data Management system and an Initial Margins tool used to calculate initial margins on all EDF Trading energy positions which would then be reconciled with the initial margin positions as specified by the clearing houses. The application wrapped a third party tool which performed the calculations and facilitated an automated process whereby input data from EDF systems was loaded on a daily basis and initial margin reports were automatically generated for the business to reconcile.
