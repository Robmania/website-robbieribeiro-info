**Allen Firth** is a software  architect / developer from **Durban, South Africa**. He studied correspondence through the University of South Africa whilst at the same time working at small software development consultancies based in Durban. In **2003** he obtained his **Bachelors Degree in Informatics**. 

Allen spent six and a half years expanding his technical horizons in **London, England**, working for some of the United Kingdoms premier corporations in **Law, Insurance and Finance**.

Today Allen has close to **two decades** worth of _in the trenches_ software development experience with a broad exposure to different industries and software development methodologies. 

He now runs his own software development consultancy [CodeStream](https://www.codestream.co.za).

The core principles of his software development philosophy are **simplicity**, **testing** and **automation**.

> Keep it simple, if a junior struggles to understand what's going on it's probably too complex.
>
> Test everything, if it ain't tested, it will break.
>
> Automate everything, if you have to do it, you will break it.
